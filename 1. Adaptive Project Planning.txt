Visit Brandwatch and log in to your account. If you don’t have an account, sign up and set up your initial dashboard.
Create a New Query:

In Brandwatch, set up a query to track specific keywords related to your banking mobile app, competitors, industry trends, or relevant topics.
Customize your query using Boolean logic to refine the search. For example, you can track mentions of your app, your competitors’ names, or specific market trends.




Data Visualization with Tableau: Connect Tableau to data sources like user analytics and project metrics from Jira or Asana. Tableau uses AI to generate real-time data visualizations, making it easy for managers to track progress and identify trends.

Predictive Analytics with Azure Machine Learning: Integrate Azure Machine Learning with the app’s backend and Tableau. Azure analyzes historical data to predict things like peak app usage and potential resource needs, and it sends forecasts to Jira or Slack for action.

Automate Reports and Alerts: Configure Tableau and Azure Machine Learning to send automated reports and alerts. For example, if Azure predicts a traffic spike, the system sends a notification to Jira, prompting the team to prepare server resources to avoid downtime.

User Feedback Integration: Connect the mobile app’s user feedback tools to Productboard. AI processes feedback to identify key trends, like frequent feature requests, and updates the prioritization list. Productboard then syncs this list with Jira for immediate action.

Market Insights Connection: Set up automated workflows where market insights from Crimson Hexagon or Google Alerts are shared with Jira. If a new competitor feature is detected, the system creates an alert, helping the team decide if adjustments are needed to stay competitive.

Sentiment Alerts for Managers: Sentiment analysis in Slack or Teams alerts managers about team stress or frustration. This allows managers to quickly address issues, like reducing workloads or offering support, to maintain productivity and morale.

Adaptive Planning with AI: AI in Jira or Asana uses all this integrated data to adapt project plans in real time. It can adjust timelines, reallocate resources, and reprioritize tasks based on current progress, team well-being, and market insights, ensuring the project stays on track.

1. Adaptive Project Planning
Real-Time Timeline Adjustments: AI analyzes data from sources like team performance (e.g., task completion rates from Jira or Asana), team well-being insights from Officevibe, and external market alerts from Brandwatch or Google Alerts. Based on this data, AI can automatically adjust project timelines. For example, if AI detects that the team is progressing faster than expected, it can suggest pulling forward certain tasks. Conversely, if new regulatory requirements are detected, it can extend deadlines to accommodate the necessary work.

Smart Task Prioritization: Using user feedback from Productboard, AI can reprioritize tasks based on the most recent user needs or market demands. If feedback shows that a specific feature is in high demand, AI can move that task up the priority list and notify the team of its importance.

2. Resource Allocation Optimization
Dynamic Resource Management: AI uses data from Azure Machine Learning and Tableau to predict future resource needs. For example, if AI forecasts a spike in app usage based on predictive analytics, it can suggest allocating additional resources, such as more developers or increasing server capacity, to handle the demand. Similarly, if team sentiment data from Officevibe shows that a team is overwhelmed, AI can recommend redistributing tasks to prevent burnout.

Automatic Workload Balancing: AI can monitor the workload of individual team members and adjust task assignments accordingly. If AI detects that a team member is overloaded, it can automatically reassign tasks to others who have more capacity. This ensures that work is evenly distributed and helps maintain productivity.

3. Proactive Risk Management
Early Detection of Potential Issues: AI continuously scans for patterns that could indicate project risks, such as delays or resource shortages. For example, if market monitoring tools like Brandwatch highlight a new competitor feature that could affect the project’s relevance, AI can flag this risk and suggest adjustments to the project roadmap. Similarly, if sentiment analysis data shows a drop in team morale, AI can alert project managers to address it before it impacts project delivery.

Scenario Planning and Simulation: AI can run simulations based on different scenarios, such as changes in project scope, market trends, or resource availability. It can then present the best course of action, helping managers make informed decisions. For instance, if AI detects a sudden change in market conditions, it can simulate how different responses (e.g., reprioritizing features or shifting resources) would impact project timelines and outcomes.

4. Continuous Learning and Improvement
Data-Driven Insights: AI learns from historical project data, identifying what worked well and what didn’t. It uses this information to improve future project planning and execution. For example, if AI notices that certain types of tasks often face delays, it can recommend strategies to mitigate these issues in future projects.

Automated Progress Updates: AI can automatically update project status and generate reports based on real-time data from various integrations. This keeps everyone on the same page and reduces the need for manual status updates, saving time and ensuring accurate reporting.

5. Enhanced Collaboration and Communication
Intelligent Notifications: AI can analyze which notifications are most relevant to team members and prioritize them accordingly. For instance, if there’s an urgent market change detected by Google Alerts, AI can immediately notify key stakeholders in Slack or Teams, ensuring quick response times.

Task Dependency Management: AI can identify dependencies between tasks and adjust project plans if there are delays. For example, if one critical task is delayed, AI can automatically reschedule dependent tasks and notify team members about the changes, minimizing disruption to the overall project flow.





Continuous Improvement Cycle: The system continually learns from new data, improving over time. User feedback, team sentiment, and market analysis are processed automatically, creating a loop of ongoing improvement and adaptability, helping the team stay efficient and responsive.
